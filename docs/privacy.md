# Privacy & Data Retention (Draft)

This document describes privacy considerations for the AI Subscription Negotiator & Bundle Optimizer.

## Principles
- Explicit, revocable user consent for any action contacting providers.
- Minimize personal data used for automated processing; store PII only when necessary.
- Allow users to export and delete their data upon request.

## Retention
- Negotiation transcripts and drafts: default 90 days; can be extended with explicit consent.
- Audit logs: retained for 1 year for dispute resolution.

## Training & Models
- Personalization models must be opt-in for global training; otherwise keep per-user models local and encrypted.
