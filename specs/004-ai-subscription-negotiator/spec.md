# Feature Specification: AI Subscription Negotiator & Bundle Optimizer

**Feature Branch**: `004-ai-subscription-negotiator`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "AI Subscription Negotiator & Bundle Optimizer"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
	‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
	‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
	‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
	‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
	‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
	‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
	- User types and permissions
	- Data retention/deletion policies  
	- Performance targets and scale
	- Error handling behaviors
	- Integration requirements
	- Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a consumer who pays for multiple digital subscriptions, I want an AI assistant that (with my explicit consent) discovers my active subscriptions, analyzes usage and costs, drafts negotiation messages to providers, and recommends bundling or plan changes so I can reduce recurring expenses and simplify account management. The AI drafts messages and suggestions but requires my approval before any communication is sent.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user with linked subscription payment methods and consent approved, **When** the AI analyzes recent billing and usage data, **Then** it identifies subscriptions with low usage and flags candidates for negotiation or cancellation.
2. **Given** a user-approved negotiation draft, **When** the user approves the message, **Then** the system sends the message to the provider on the user's behalf and records the outcome and any offer returned.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a provider refuses to negotiate or respond? The system records the outcome and surfaces recommendations for manual follow-up.  
- How to handle subscriptions that cannot be linked automatically (e.g., paid via cash or third-party billing)? Mark as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: manual linking process and supported payment sources].
- If provider contact information is not available, AI should present recommended message text for the user to send manually.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST require explicit, revocable user consent before performing any negotiation or communication with providers on the user's behalf.
- **FR-002**: System MUST discover and import a user's subscriptions through linked payment methods, manual entry, or supported integrations (bank/transaction parsing, merchant connectors).
- **FR-003**: System MUST analyze subscription usage and billing history to estimate value and identify low-utility subscriptions.
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate negotiation drafts (email/chat messages) tailored to each provider and present them to the user for approval before sending.
- **FR-005**: System MUST send approved communications on behalf of the user via supported channels (email, provider webchat, or present copy for manual sending) and log outcomes.
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain an auditable history of negotiations, user approvals, and outcomes for transparency and reversibility.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide bundle optimization suggestions showing estimated savings, required trade-offs, and any changes to features or limits.
- **FR-008**: System MUST include a UI for users to accept, reject, or modify suggested bundles and negotiation drafts.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to set negotiation goals or preferences (e.g., minimum acceptable discount, privacy constraints, auto-approve rules) and honor these settings.
- **FR-010**: System MUST anonymize or limit sensitive data when contacting providers and allow users to review what personal data will be shared in each draft.
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to manually link subscriptions that automated discovery cannot find.
- **FR-012**: System MUST present a savings tracker summarizing realized savings from negotiations and bundle changes.

*Unclear / Needs Clarification*
- **FR-013**: System MUST support automatic sending through phone-call proxies or on-platform chatbots [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: acceptable channels and legal/terms constraints].
- **FR-014**: System MUST store negotiation strategy models and training data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention, user consent for model training].

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **User Profile**: Represents the user, consent state, preferences, negotiation goals, and linked payment sources.
  - Attributes: `user_id`, `consent_status`, `negotiation_preferences`, `linked_accounts`
- **Subscription**: Represents an individual subscription service.
  - Attributes: `subscription_id`, `provider_name`, `plan`, `cost`, `billing_cycle`, `linked_account`, `usage_metrics`
- **NegotiationDraft**: A generated message intended for a provider.
  - Attributes: `draft_id`, `subscription_id`, `provider_contact`, `message_text`, `created_at`, `status`, `user_approved_at`
- **NegotiationOutcome**: Records responses and result of a negotiation.
  - Attributes: `outcome_id`, `draft_id`, `response_summary`, `offer_details`, `result`, `timestamp`
- **BundleSuggestion**: Suggested combined plan or provider switch with estimated savings.
  - Attributes: `suggestion_id`, `involved_subscriptions`, `estimated_savings`, `tradeoffs`, `confidence_score`
